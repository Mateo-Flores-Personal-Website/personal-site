# personal-site

Hi! Thanks for visiting my personal site. Here you can find some information about me, such as my hobbies and my previous projects. I have not revealed enough information to endanger myself, so please be considerate of that. On the footer of the page you will find links leading to my socials!

On my YouTube you will find simple coding and design tutorials.

By clicking on the names of my projects you can visit the source code. If you enjoy the site and want to connect: add me on linkedin or tweet at me!
